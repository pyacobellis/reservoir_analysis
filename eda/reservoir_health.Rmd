## Context and Objectives

What are we trying to achieve?

-   Understand reservoir / catchment health data patterns
-   Identify patterns / risks / anomalies
-   Recommended monitoring and simple predictive tools

## Data Science Approach

-   Examine data & take hand written notes
-   Tools:
    -    Hypothesize in R, Productionise in Python
    -   Viz: ggplot2, esquisse, patchwork, Streamlit for production
    -   git for version control <https://github.com/pyacobellis/reservoir_analysis>
    -   AI - Co-Pilot / ChatGPT, Visual Studio Code
-   Exploratory Data Analysis
    -   Data Profile
    -   Biased Data Detection
    -   Missing Value Analysis
    -   Outlier Detection
-   Analysis
    -   Diagnostic Signals (Viz) –\>
    -   Statistical Support –\>
    -   Predictive Modelling
-   Sense check intepretations and AI results with SME - flood modeler, engineer, and water economist

## Key Insights and Findings

### Key Insight 1: Rain -\> Turbidity Lag Effect

-   Sharp rise in turbidity follows peak rain event

-   CCF Plot supports this relationship

\newpage

### Key Insight 2: Depth Analysis

-   DO stable at 0 - 40m - suggests algal bloom risk lower.

-   Water Temperature increases over time, as temperature would cool?
