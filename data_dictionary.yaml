    description: Timestamp of measurement
    type: POSIXct
    format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
    example: "2016-01-19 00:05:44"

  depth:
    description: Depth at which measurement was taken
    type: numeric
    units: meters
    example: 6.037

variable:
  description: Type of environmental measurement relevant to dam and reservoir behaviour
  type: categorical
  categories:
    rainfall: >
      Precipitation falling onto the reservoir catchment, influencing inflows,
      storage levels, runoff quality, and flood operations.
      Taken daily.
    dissolved oxygen: >
      Concentration of oxygen dissolved in the water column, critical for aquatic
      health, stratification dynamics, and treatment considerations.
    evapotranspiration: >
      Combined water loss from evaporation and vegetation transpiration, affecting
      reservoir water balance and long‑term storage trends. Taken daily.
    turbidity: >
      Cloudiness of the water caused by suspended particles such as clay, silt,
      algae, or organic matter; often increases after rainfall and affects
      treatment processes and ecological conditions.
    water temperature: >
      Thermal conditions of the reservoir, influencing stratification, dissolved
      oxygen levels, algal growth, and operational decisions such as offtake depth.
